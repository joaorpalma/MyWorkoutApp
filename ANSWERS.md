1. Total time spent: 4 Days ( ~4 hours each day) = ~16h
2. How challenging did you find the task: [ x ] Easy [ ] Medium [ ] Hard
3. What were the most challenging parts: Update scrollview content when keyboard appears, to work well in portrait and landscape.

4. Any additional comments about the task/implementation: 

- I added Light and Dart Mode
- The app works in landscape and portrait

5. If you had more time to complete the test, are there any specific changes/refactoring that you would have liked to do: 

- Create a real database, a json file works well but all data is lost on compile.

- To test the persisted data, kill the app and open it again. (If you compile it, the data will be erased.)
